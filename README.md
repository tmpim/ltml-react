# ltml-react

A test project for making a React-like framework using [fengari](https://github.com/fengari-lua/fengari) and [ltml](https://github.com/tmpim/ltml).

# Notes

This project is on an older version of LTML, due to having to modify the imports since `require` in fengari-loader uses JavaScript style imports. Additionally, this project is postponed until LTML is a more stable state and there is a solution for the fengari-loader imports. Hopefully at some point this will change, but for the time being it is not recommended that you use LTML-react in a production environment.
